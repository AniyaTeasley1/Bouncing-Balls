# Bouncing Balls Simulation

## Description
This project simulates multiple bouncing balls with random attributes such as size, color, speed, and direction. The balls move around the screen, bouncing off the edges, and users can dynamically control the number of balls, their speed, and their direction.

## Features
- Multiple balls with random size, color, speed, and direction.
- Dynamic controls to increase/decrease the number of bouncing balls.
- Option to alter the direction and speed of a selected ball.
- Fun and interactive visual simulation.

## How to Run
1. **Clone the repository**:
   Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AniyaTeasley1/Bouncing-Balls.git
Navigate to the project directory: Move into the directory where the code is located:

bash
Copy code
cd Bouncing-Balls
Compile the Java program: Since this is a multi-file project, you will need to compile all the .java files in the project. You can do this with the javac command:

bash
Copy code
javac *.java
This command compiles all .java files in the current directory. If your project has subdirectories, you might need to specify the location of the files or include subdirectories in the command.

Run the Java program: After compiling all the files, run the program using the java command, specifying the class with the main method (usually the entry point of your program). For example, if the main class is Main.java, run:

bash
Copy code
java Main
If your entry point is in a different class, substitute Main with the name of the class that contains the public static void main(String[] args) method.

Requirements
Java 8 or higher: Make sure Java is installed on your machine. You can download it from Oracle's website.
A Java development environment (IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or the command line).
