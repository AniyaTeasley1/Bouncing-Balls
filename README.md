# Bouncing Balls Simulation

## Description
This project simulates multiple bouncing balls with random attributes such as size, color, speed, and direction. The balls move around the screen, bouncing off the edges, and users can dynamically control the number of balls, their speed, and their direction.

## Features
- Multiple balls with random size, color, speed, and direction.
- Dynamic controls to increase/decrease the number of bouncing balls.
- Option to alter the direction and speed of a selected ball.
- Fun and interactive visual simulation.
